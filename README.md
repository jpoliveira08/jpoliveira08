## Hi there, I'm João Pedro

I am a 4rd year student in electrical engineering at UTFPR (Federal University of Technology – Paraná), where I had my first contact with programming using the language C. At this time I am participating in a University project, which has the objective to build a hardware and software (Kotlin/C) for mobile devices, that allows the user to measure the real time energy consumed in their house.

Also, in the moment I'm doing an internship, working as a Full Stack developer using technologies like: Linux, Docker, PHP, Javascript, SQL, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

I seek to learn and apply good practicing in code with Clean Code, Object Calisthenics and Design Patterns. My main areas of interest are Backend and Mobile App development.
