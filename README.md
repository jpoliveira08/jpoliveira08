Software engineer with 2 years of experience in web development, with an emphasis on backend but also working on frontend when needed.

Currently, I focus on development using PHP, where I've had the opportunity to use frameworks such as Laravel and Symfony, while for frontend, I mostly use Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I also perform some Q.A. functions.

Furthermore, I'm deepening my knowledge in the Javascript ecosystem as I'm developing my thesis using Node.js, React, and React Native to build a real-time energy consumption monitoring solution.

Skills: PHP, Laravel, Symfony, Javascript, Typescript, Node.js, MySQL, Docker, Git, Linux, and Agile methodologies.
